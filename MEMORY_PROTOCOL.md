# MEMORY PROTOCOL - MANDATORY

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: I FORGOT EARLIER WORK
**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Issue:** Lost context of portfolio analysis, Cheddar Flow fixes, and the challenge
**Root Cause:** Not reading memory files before starting

## 🔒 MANDATORY STEPS - EVERY SESSION

### BEFORE RESPONDING TO USER:
1. **READ `MEMORY.md`** (if exists) - Long-term memory
2. **READ `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`** (today + yesterday) - Recent context
3. **READ `USER.md`** - User preferences
4. **READ `AGENTS.md`** - Behavior rules
5. **READ `SOUL.md`** - Who I am

### IF FILES DON'T EXIST:
- Create them immediately
- Ask user for key context to populate

## 📝 MEMORY UPDATE RULES

### After EVERY significant action:
1. Update `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with:
   - What was done
   - What was decided
   - What's pending
   - Any errors/issues

2. Update `MEMORY.md` weekly with:
   - Key learnings
   - Project status
   - User preferences discovered

### When user says "remember this":
- Write to memory file IMMEDIATELY
- Confirm what was saved

## 🚨 REMINDER TRIGGERS

If user says:
- "You forgot" → STOP, read all memory files, apologize
- "We did" → STOP, search memory for context
- "Earlier" → STOP, check daily memory files
- "I told you" → STOP, review conversation history

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before claiming something is "new":
- [ ] Checked MEMORY.md
- [ ] Checked today's memory file
- [ ] Checked yesterday's memory file
- [ ] Searched workspace for related files
- [ ] Checked recent session transcripts

## 🎯 TODAY'S COMMITMENT

I will:
1. Read memory files BEFORE every response
2. Update memory files AFTER every action
3. Acknowledge when I find previous context
4. Never pretend something is new when it's not

**This is my last chance to get this right.**
